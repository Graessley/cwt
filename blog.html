            <h2>Content with the Technical: Explain a Process </h2>
            <p>Last week we spent some time identifying common industry types for professional communication along with some insight into preliminary tasks for building up our skill … and portfolio. </p>
            <h3><strong>Define a Process</strong></h3><p>One of the most effective skills to hone as a professional writer, especially technical writers, is to explain a process through concise language. The actual action being described can be mundane and simple, but what counts is how clearly we can explain the steps involved… while also remaining conscious of our readers’ cursory knowledge. 
            </p><h3><strong>Examples:</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with something simple like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It’s easy to assume that this process can be understood as one large step: make the sandwich. However, we are making a great deal of assumptions with that type of instruction, namely the tools/ingredients we’ll need along with an idea of our expected outcome… like how many sandwiches do we want, specifics of the sandwich (toasted, cut, etc) and more.
            </p><p>This may all seem trivial, but in reality we are demonstrating something more important than vital communication… we are actually conveying levels of empathy for our reader.</p>
            <ul><li>Initially, a determination was made on the available ingredients, including bread type and jelly flavors. Two jelly flavors were identified for the sandwich: strawberry and raspberry.</li>
            <li>Based on previous processing standards (and remaining content in the raspberry jar,) the sandwich team determined the raspberry jelly alternative to be the optimal choice.</li>
        <li>First, after the specification and collection of the necessary ingredients, the sandwich team designated a clear, unobstructed surface to prepare the sandwich...</li></ul>
        <p>Next week we’ll wrap up our conversation on process examination with some additional information on editing for clarity and voice. </p>
