            <h2>Content with the Technical: Explain a Process </h2>
            <p>Last week we spent some time identifying common industry types for professional communication along with some insight into preliminary tasks for building up our skill … and portfolio. </p>
            <h3><strong>Define a Process</strong></h3><p>One of the most effective skills to hone as a professional writer, especially technical writers, is to explain a process through concise language. The actual action being described can be mundane and simple, but what counts is how clearly we can explain the steps involved… while also remaining conscious of our readers’ cursory knowledge. 
            </p><h3><strong>Examples:</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with something simple like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It’s easy to assume that this process can be understood as one large step: make the sandwich. However, we are making a great deal of assumptions with that type of instruction, namely the tools/ingredients we’ll need along with an idea of our expected outcome… like how many sandwiches do we want, specifics of the sandwich (toasted, cut, etc) and more.
            </p><p>This may all seem trivial, but in reality we are demonstrating something more important than vital communication… we are actually conveying levels of empathy for our reader.</p>
            <ul><li>Initially, a determination was made on the available ingredients, including bread type and jelly flavors. Two jelly flavors were identified for the sandwich: strawberry and raspberry.</li>
            <li>Based on previous processing standards (and remaining content in the raspberry jar,) the sandwich team determined the raspberry jelly alternative to be the optimal choice.</li>
        <li>First, after the specification and collection of the necessary ingredients, the sandwich team designated a clear, unobstructed surface to prepare the sandwich...</li></ul>
        <p>Next week we’ll wrap up our conversation on process examination with some additional information on editing for clarity and voice. </p>

            <h2>Content with the Technical: Industry Types, Early Research, and Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Professional communication, especially copy and technical writing, can be a challenging field to break into, but there are a few reliable routes to gain experience that can be done without the need for high-priority internships or expensive formal training.</p>
            <p>It starts with an identification of common industry types. Today, we’ll focus on broad categories such as Software Developments and Manufacturing Engineering. Of course, there is a ton of nuance within the larger category ‘buckets’ enough to create ‘subcategories’ to account for specific fields within an industry such as printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing or mobile app developments… with subcategories within subcategories.</p>
            <h3><strong>Getting Started:</strong></h3><p>Spend some extra time researching available markets, our research can begin by identifying the products or programs we use in our daily lives. Nearly any retail product or service offers a version of technical or consumer communication… At the very least, we can improve upon the content already available.</p>
            <p>This could be something mundane like kitchen appliances or more complicated like PC components (for example, maybe the latest wireless gaming headset or oil-free air fryer).</p>
            <p>Picking a topic that carries some level of interest will greatly help us in the next part of our exercise.</p>
            <h3><strong>Popular Types of Technical/Professional Writing:</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, and Life Sciences</li>
                <li>Manufacturing: mechanical, defense, transportation, etc</li>
                <li>Information Technology, Research, and Banking/Finance</li>
                <li>Software Development: Gaming, Mobile Apps, Websites</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Explain a Process:</strong></h3>
            <p>After we’ve determined the specific industry and product (or product line) we want to focus our research on, now we can start putting together a new writing sample. For the purposes of this exercise, we will create a simple “How-to-Use” guide that explains, through concise language, the optimal step-by-step approach for setting up or effectively using a product.</p>
            <p>Next week, we will go through some examples of the drafting process and identify some potential pitfalls to avoid when describing the material to help ensure our readers can easily follow along.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember!</strong>Try to pick an industry/product of interest… it will make showcasing the important details that much easier.</p>
