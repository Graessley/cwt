    <h1>Setting Up Reusable Templates for Common Content Types</h1>
    <p>Reusable templates are an excellent way to quickly generate similar content types that adhere to all style guide requirements. Depending on the organization's requirements, this can present a tedious and time-consuming task. Follow these simple steps to start creating robust templates that are ready to populate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start by launching MS Word and opening a blank document. Here, we will need to set up our custom formatting and style guide parameters.</li>
      <img src="wiki Word.png/>
      <li>The image displays the vital information needed for the document type, along with font, size, and line spacing.</li>
      <li>Now, to save this file into a reusable format, we will need to navigate to the left corner to the File -> Save as Template selector.</li>
      <li>Within the Save As box, give the template a strong reference, such as Interview Template</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lastly, select the save location for the template file. It is recommended that a new "Template Folder" be created should there be a need for multiple template types. Afterwards, let's test the output by starting up a new template document. Navigate once more to the File button at the top left corner of the interface. If saved correctly, the new template will be an available option in the display.</p>
