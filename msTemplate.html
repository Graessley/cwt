  <title>Microsoft Word Template Guide</title>
  </head>
<body>
<p>Reusable templates are an excellent way to quickly generate similar content types that adhere to all style guide requirements. Depending on the organization's requirements, this can present a tedious and time-consuming task. Follow these simple steps to start creating robust templates that are ready to populate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by launching MS Word and opening a blank document. Here, we will need to set up our custom formatting and style guide parameters</li>
      <image src="wikiWord.jpeg" alt="word document" style="position:absolute; left:0px;"></a>
      <li>The image displays the vital information needed for the document type, along with font, size, and line spacing</li>
      <li>Now, to save this file into a reusable format, we will need to navigate to the left corner to the File -> Save as Template selector</li>
      <li>Within the Save As box, give the template a strong reference, such as Interview Template</li>
      <li> Lastly, select the save location for the template file - it is recommended that a new Template Folder be created, should there be a need for multiple template types</li>
    </ol>
<p>If saved correctly, the new template will be an available option in the display.</p>
